## Commands

### 1. Service Management

- **List Running Services**: Lists all active system services.

   ```bash
   sysopctl service list
   ```

- **Start a Service**: Start a specific service. Replace `<service-name>` with the name of the service you wish to start.

   ```bash
   sysopctl service start <service-name>
   ```

- **Stop a Service**: Stop a specific service. Replace `<service-name>` with the name of the service you wish to stop.

   ```bash
   sysopctl service stop <service-name>
   ```

### 2. System Monitoring

- **View System Load**: Display the current system load averages (1, 5, 15 minutes) similar to the uptime command.

   ```bash
   sysopctl system load
   ```

- **Check Disk Usage**: Display disk usage statistics by partition (similar to `df -h`).

   ```bash
   sysopctl disk usage
   ```

### 3. Process Monitoring

- **Monitor System Processes**: Show real-time process activity, similar to `top` or `htop`.

   ```bash
   sysopctl process monitor
   ```

### 4. Log Analysis

- **Analyze System Logs**: Display recent critical log entries, using tools like `journalctl`.

   ```bash
   sysopctl logs analyze
   ```

### 5. Backup System Files

- **Backup Files**: Create a backup of system files at a specified path. Replace `<path>` with the directory you wish to back up.

   ```bash
   sysopctl backup <path>
   ```

## Examples

- **To list all running services**:

   ```bash
   sysopctl service list
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   UNIT                                   LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
   apache2.service                       loaded active running The Apache HTTP Server
   ssh.service                           loaded active running OpenSSH server daemon
   ```

- **To start the apache2 service**:

   ```bash
   sysopctl service start apache2
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Starting apache2 service...
   ```

- **To check system load**:

   ```bash
   sysopctl system load
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Load averages: 0.51 0.42 0.48
   ```

- **To check disk usage**:

   ```bash
   sysopctl disk usage
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
   /dev/sda1       100G   45G   50G  48% /
   ```

- **To back up files from /home/user**:

   ```bash
   sysopctl backup /home/user
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Backing up files from /home/user...
   Backup completed successfully.
   ```
